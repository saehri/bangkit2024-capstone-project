## Our Machine Learning Architecture

- The architecture is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) using a pre-trained MobileNet model as the base.
- The model is structured as a sequential model, which includes:
- A base model (MobileNet) for feature extraction.
- Additional layers such as:
  - A convolutional layer (Conv2D) with 32 filters and a kernel size of 3.
  - A global average pooling layer (GlobalAveragePooling2D).
  - A dense layer with a softmax activation function for classification into three categories (dry, normal, oily).

## Tools and Library Used

- TensorFlow/Keras: The primary library used for building and training the model.
- ImageDataGenerator: For data augmentation and preprocessing of images.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing training progress and results.
- ImageIO: For reading images.
